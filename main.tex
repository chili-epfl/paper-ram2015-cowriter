\section{A different paradigm for educative robots}

Henry is five and an half, and has been diagnosed with visuo-constructive
deficits. He is under the care of an occupational therapist, and tries to
workaround his inability to draw letters in a consistent manner. Diego is six
and struggles at school with his poor handwriting and even poorer
self-confidence.

While Henry is lively and always quick at shifting his attention from one
activity to another, Diego is shy and poised. Two very different children,
facing however the same difficulty to write in a legible manner. And, hidden
behind this impaired skill, psycho-social difficulties also arise: they
underperform at school, Henry has to go for follow-up visits to a therapist,
they require ``special care''. This is a source of anxiety, for the children,
and for their parents alike.

\end{figure}

Remediations for handwriting difficulties traditionally involve
long interventions (at least 10 weeks~\cite{Hoy2011}), essentially handwriting
training with an occu therapist, and primarly address the motor deficits.
Improvements in self-confidence, anxiety occur (at best) as a consequence of the
child improving his/her handwriting skills and improving his/her performances at
school (when not too late).

We present in this article a new take on this educative challenge, as a
remediation procedure that involve a bad-writer robot that is taught by the
child: by building on the \emph{learning by teaching} paradigm, not only the
child practises hand-writing but, as he/she takes on the role of the teacher,
he/she also positively reinforce his/her self-esteem and motivation (he/she
shifts from the ``underperformer'' to become ``the one who knows and teaches'').

\subsection{Learning by Teaching}

The \emph{learning by teaching} paradigm, which engages the target student in
the act of teaching another, has been shown to produce motivational,
meta-cognitive, and educational benefits in a range of disciplines~\cite{Rohrbeck2003}. 
To our best knowledge, the application of the paradigm to
handwriting intervention remains, however, unexplored. One reason for this may
due to the requirement of an appropriately unskilled peer for the target child
to tutor, as this may present a logistical constraint if the target child is the
lowest performer in their class.  In some cases, it may be appropriate for a
peer or teacher to simulate a na\"ive learner for the target child to teach.
For handwriting, where one's skill level is visually evident, however, this
acting is likely to be eventually detected. As such, there is motivation for the
use of a teachable agent which can be configured for a variety of skill levels,
and for which children do not have preconceptions about its handwriting ability.

Robots have been used as teachers or social partners to promote children's
learning in a range of contexts, most commonly related to language
skills~\cite{han2010robot}, and less often to physical skills (such as
calligraphy~\cite{Matsui2013}).  Looking at the converse (humans \emph{teaching}
robots), Werfel notes in~\cite{Werfel2014} that most of the work focuses on the
robot's benefits (in terms of language~\cite{Saunders2010} or
physical~\cite{Mulling2013} skills, for example) rather than the learning
experienced by the human tutor themselves.  Our work concentrates on this latter
aspect: by demonstrating handwriting to a robot, we aim at improving the
\emph{child's} performance. Note that our work must be distinguished from
``learning from demonstration'' approaches to robots learning physical skills,
as the agent we present is only simulating fine motor skills for interaction
purposes.

A robotic learning agent which employs the learning by teaching paradigm has
previously been developed by Tanaka and Matsuzoe~\cite{Tanaka2012}. In their
system, children learn vocabulary by teaching the {\sc nao} robot to act out
verbs. The robot is tele-operated and mimics the actions that the children teach
it, but with no long-term memory or learning algorithm in place.  Our project
significantly extends this line of work in two ways. First, by investigating the
context of children's acquisition of a challenging physical skill (handwriting),
and second by proposing a robotic partner which is fully autonomous in its
learning.


\subsection{Teaching beyond ICT}

This research departs from the traditional approaches to educative robotics
(\fixme{cite reviews})

Also notable, the robot is not used in the usual context of robotics or computer
education, but instead in an activity -- handwriting -- which requires fine
physical skills. In such activities, the embodied nature of the robot is
appropriate as in interventions where motor mimicry is elicited
\cite{Berninger1997} the arm motion for instance is, \emph{by itself}, part of
the teaching. Furthermore, when facing a child with school difficulties, robots
can play the role of a na\"ive learner which neither adults nor peers -- because
of the social effects it would induce -- can convincingly play. Along these
lines, we hope to see more research on non-STEM educational applications of
robotics.

Beyond handwriting, we believe that this work provides a novel perspective on
the role for robots in the field of education. \emph{Learning by teaching} is a
powerful paradigm because of not only its pedagogical efficacy, but its
potential to positively impact the child's motivation and self-esteem. We hope that 
this article shows that this is a very relevant context of use for robots. Indeed,
when facing a child with school difficulties, robots can play the role of a na\"ive 
learner which neither adults nor peers -- because of the social effects it would 
induce -- can convincingly play.

\subsection{Agency and Commitment}

However, we believe that the strongest impact of this work is for the
human-robot interaction community and relates to the very \emph{nature} of the
interaction fostered by this research. The work presented here investigates a
particular role for a robot in the education of handwriting: not only is the
robot actively performing the activity by drawing letters, but it does so in a
way that engages the child in a very specific social role. The child is the
teacher in this relationship and the robot is the learner: the child must engage
in a (meta-) cognitive relationship with the robot to try to understand why the
robot fails and how to help it best.  Here, the robot is more than just an
activity facilitator or orchestrator -- its physical presence and embodiment
induce agency and anthropomorphising, and cognitively engage the child into the
learning activity, which we predict will lead to higher learning efficacy.


\subsection*{Overview of the article}

We have sofar frame our intents: to design a robotic system that would support
handwriting remediation in an original way: by getting children to teach a
robotic agent how to write, those children would both practise without knowing
it and recover self-confidence and self-esteem by supporting a
worst-than-themselves robotic ``student''.

The following sections of the paper go into details. The next section provides a
brief overview of the robotic system and the interaction it induces. We then
give the details of machine-learning techniques that allow the robot to learn
from the children, followed by the implementation on the Nao robot.

Next, we present and report on the four school experiments and the two case
studies that we conducted over the last two years. While the focus of the school
experiments was mostly technical validation and data acquisition, the two case
studies that lasted each about 4 weeks, gave us initial insights on the
relevance and effectiveness of our approach.

\section{Implementation of the Interaction}

Figure~\ref{experimental_setup} illustrates our general experimental setup: a
face-to-face child-robot interaction with an (autonomous) Aldebran's Nao robot.

A tactile tablet (with a custom application) is used for both the robot and the
child to write: during a typical round, the child requests the robot to write
something (a single letter, a number or a full word), and push the tablet
towards the robot, the robot writes on the tablet by gesturing the writing, but
\emph{without actually physically touching the tablet}), the child then pull
back the tablet, correct the robot's attempt by writing him/herself on top or
next to the robot's writing (see the picture in Figure~\ref{fig:diego}), and
``send'' his/her demonstration to the robot by pressing a small button on the
tablet. The robot ``learns'' from this demonstration and tries again.

Since the child is assumed to take on the role of the teacher, we had to ensure
he/she would be able to manage by him/herself the turn-taking and the overall
progression of the activity (moving to the next letter or word). In our design,
the turn-taking relies on the robot prompting for feedback once it is done with
its writing (simple sentences like ``What do you think?''), and pressing on a
small robot icon on the tablet once the child has finished correcting. In our
experiments, both were easy to grasp for children.


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{experimental_setup}
    \caption{\small Our experimental setup: face-to-face interaction with a {\sc nao} robot.
        The robot writes on the tactile tablet, the child then corrects the
        robot by directly overwriting its letters on the tablet, with a stylus
        directly. An adult (either a therapist or an experimenter, depending on
        the studies), remains next to the child to guide the work (prompting,
        turn taking, etc.). For some studies, a second tablet and an additional
        camera (dashed) are employed.}

    \label{experimental_setup}
\end{figure}

Implementing such a system raises several challenges: first, acquiring,
analyzing and learning from hand-written demonstration lays at the core of the
our approach and we developed several algorithms for the robot to generate
initial bad writing and to respond in an adequate manner, showing visible (but
not too quick) writing improvements.

Then, the actual implementation on the robot required the coordination of
several modules (from performing gestures and acquiring the user's input to
the high-level state machine), spread over several machines (the robot itself,
one laptop and up to four tactile tablets for certain studies we conducted). We
relied on ROS to ensure the synchronization and communication between these
modules.

Finally, the interaction itself, involving a robot, one or two children and, in
one study, an occupational therapist, also raised by itself several challenges.

We detail each of these points in the following sections.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Generating and Learning Letters}

Since our application is about teaching a robot to write, generating (initially
bad) letters and learning from demonstrations is a core aspect of the project.

The main insight for both the generation and the learning of letters is to
reason in the eigenspace of the letters, instead of the cartesian space. The
eigen space of each letters is spanned by the first $n$ eigenvectors (in our
experiments, $3 < n < 6$) of the covariance matrix observed in a standard
dataset of adult letters (the UJI Pen Characters 2 dataset~\cite{Llorens2008}).
This procedure, based on a Principle Component Analysis (PCA), is explained in
details in a previously published article~\cite{hood2015when}.

By changing the eigenvalues associated to these eigenvectors and regenerating
letters with the reverse procedure, it becomes then easy to generate new
letters, with distortions that are actually plausible handwriting errors: they
are actually \emph{exaggerations} of variance of writing styles that naturally
exist amongst adult writers.  Figure~\ref{fig:sampleLetters} shows examples of
deformed ``e'' and ``g'' generated with such a technique.

\begin{figure}[thpb]
\centering
\subfigure{\raisebox{-0.5\height}{\includegraphics[width=0.08\columnwidth]{e1.png}}}
\subfigure{\raisebox{-0.5\height}{\includegraphics[width=0.08\columnwidth]{e4.png}}}

\caption{\small \label{fig:sampleLetters}Sample letters generated from the PCA shape
model on ``e'' (left) and ``g'' paths (right), generated randomly from
parameters with $3\times$ the standard deviation observed in the dataset.}

\end{figure}

The same technique can be applied to \emph{classify} demonstrations,
\emph{assess} their quality and
\emph{learn} from them. Figure~\ref{fig:h} shows 9 allographs of ``h'' written by a 6
years old child, along with the mean letter from the
dataset (reference letter). By projecting each of the demonstrations onto the eigenspace
of ``h'' (Figure~\ref{fig:h}b), we observe that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the different allographs can by clustered (with a $k$-means or
        mean-shift algorithm) by their visual styles,
    \item we can compute an euclidian distance to the reference letter to assess
        the visual proximity of the demonstration with the expected letter, thus
        providing a quantitative metric of writing performance.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \subfigure[Nine allographs of the cursive ``h'', next to the reference]{
        \includegraphics[height=4.1cm]{h}
    }
    \subfigure[Same samples, normalized and projected in the eigen space spanned from the
        3 first eigenvectors: clusters arise, that actually match writing styles.]{
        \includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{eigenspace-uniformization}
    }

    \caption{\small Projecting demonstrated letters onto the eigenspace
    generated from the reference dataset effectively clusters the samples
    according to their topological similarity. Allographs that are visually similar to
    the reference are close to it in the eigenspace.}
    \label{fig:h}
\end{figure}

The algorithm for machine-learning becomes then a simple matter of converging at
a specific pace towards the child demonstration in the eigenspace.
Figure~\ref{learning_6_demos}, at the end of the article, shows a complete learning cycle
with the number ``6''.

\subsection{Robotic Implementation}

Our system is embodied through an Aldebaran's {\sc nao} (V4 or V5, depending on the studies)
humanoid robot. This choice is motivated by its approachable
design~\cite{Gouaillier2008}, its size (58cm) and inherently safe structure (lightweight
plastic) (making it suitable for close interaction with children), its low price
(making it closer to what school may afford in the coming years) and finally its
ease of deployment on the field.

{\sc nao} is a humanoid biped, has 25 degrees of freedom,
two cameras, speech capabilities and the ability to autonomously execute a range
of tasks. While it can walk, this capability is not used in this project, and
the robot remains in a crouching posture during the whole interaction.

Robotic handwriting requires precise closed-loop control of the arm and hand
motion. Because of the limited fine motor skills possible
with such an affordable robot, in addition to the absence of force feedback and
other technical necessities, we have opted for \emph{simulated
handwriting}: the robot draws letters in the air, and the actual writing is
displayed on a synchronised tablet.

}

\caption{\small Overview of the system. In total, the system runs about 10 ROS nodes,
    distributed over the robot itself, a central laptop and Android tablets.}

    \label{fig:archi}
\end{figure}

The overall architecture of the system (Figure~\ref{fig:archi}) is therefore
spread over several devices: the {\sc nao} robot itself, that we address via
both a ROS API\footnote{The ROS stack for {\sc nao} is available at
\url{http://wiki.ros.org/nao_robot}.} and the Aldebaran-provided NaoQI API, one
to four Android tablets (the main tablet is used to print the robot's letter and
to acquire the children' demonstrations. More tablets have been used in some
studies, either to let the child input words to be written, or for the
experimenter to qualitatively annotate the interaction in a synchronized
fashion), and a central laptop running the machine learning algorithms, the
robot's handwriting gesture generation and high level control of the activity.

Since the system does not actually require any CPU-intensive process, the laptop
could be removed and the whole logic could run on the robot. Due to the relative
difficulty to deploy and debug ROS nodes directly on the robot, we however
effectively kept the laptop during our experiments.

Most of the nodes are written in Python, and the whole source code of the
project is available online\footnote{The primary repository is
\url{https://github.com/chili-epfl/cowriter_letter_learning}.}

\subsubsection*{Trajectory Following Movements}

Using simulated handwriting provides an opportunity for the robot's writing to
appear smoother than would be achievable with a writing instrument. However, the
robot's motions must still sufficiently match the displayed trajectory in order
capture the engagement of the child participant in the action. Aldebaran's NaoQi
API is used for the inverse kinematics of the trajectory following. ROS is used
for integration of {\sc nao} with external reference frames, such as the
tablet's location, using the $tf$ transformation library~\cite{Foote2013}.

When using simulated handwriting, it is no longer necessary that the robot
engages in the typical style of handwriting of using a writing instrument at a
desk. Having instead the robot point at the writing surface to cause the
trajectory to appear (as seen in Figure \ref{fig:schools}, left) has several advantages:

\begin{itemize}

    \item The working space of the robot increases, both in the technical sense
        and the interaction sense: someone can, in theory, show the tablet to
        the robot from across the room and have it still respond, without
        needing the tablet to be within arm's reach,

    \item Concerns about whether or not the child would start mimicking the
        robot's incorrect writing form (\eg pen grip) are mitigated,

    \item Perhaps most significantly, the accuracy of the matching of the
        robot's motion with the trajectory displayed on the tablet is not as
        critical. This is because a pen tip would be expected to touch the
        tablet exactly at the trajectory point, while a fingertip may not.

\end{itemize}
%
%\begin{figure}[thpb]
%     \begin{center}
%            \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{naoWriting2.png}
%    \end{center}
%    \caption{\small A demonstration of the robot simulating the writing of a word with
%    its finger. The motion of the robot is synchronised with the display of the
%    tablet, communicating over ROS.}%
%
%   \label{fig:naoWriting}

We have therefore designed the system in such a way that the robot is simulating
handwriting by pointing at the tablet\footnote{Teachers interviewed for their
feedback on the system advised that children are asked to draw letters in
the air in a similar manner as part of their handwriting education. The
behaviour is hence not unfamiliar to children.}. As interacting with a
tablet with one's finger is not uncommon, this may aid the acceptance of the
writing style by users. 

Because motion planning is performed with respect to the hand of the robot,
rather than its fingertip, one or two of the orientation degrees of freedom of
the hand are fixed to keep the finger approximately perpendicular to the writing
surface, depending on the desired accuracy. The remaining free orientation(s),
coupled with the whole-body motion control available, allow for a sufficient
working space for writing on the entire tablet.

\section{Field Studies}

To date, the presented system has been deployed and tested in three different
schools (totalling child-robot interactions with more than 70 children, aged 5
to 8) and we also conducted 2 case studies over several weeks.
Table~\ref{studies} gives an overview of these studies.

\paragraph{Engagement levels}

A conclusion drawn in a systematic review of classical handwriting
interventions~\cite{Hoy2011} is that any of the studies considered which
involved fewer than two practice sessions per week and fewer than a total of 20
practice sessions, including homework, were not found to demonstrate effective
results. This highlights the necessity to engage students in an interaction
which will be sustainable over the long-term if we want to address research
questions which involve the measurement of learning gains.

\subsection{Case Study 1: Diego}

\subsubsection{Context, Study Design}
It was the first time we where trying a long-terme interaction between a child
and the CoWriter robot. So the first aim of this study was to see if such an
interaction was simply possible. If we could create an environement to keep a child engaged
during one hour just in writing words with the robot.
The second question was focused on the content of the interaction. Our goal was
to figure out what extent the child would actually improve the robot's
writing.\\

Diego is a six years old child. 
Before the experiment, we could create a dataset of letters based on his main
mistakes, but amplifiyed by PCA. Our idea was to make the robot
exaggerating the mistakes of Diego. Thus, by correcting the robot, 
Diego was actually going to correct himself.\\

The experiment took one month. It was divided in four sessions of one hour, one session per week.
In order to justify to the child an activity where a robot wants to learn
handwriting, we decided to adduce a scenario. There where two Nao robots: a
blue one (Mimi) and an orange one (Clem). They where introduced to the child as
two hold friends. Mimi was left, and the two robots were corresponding by
handwrited mails. But Clem was begining in writing and it needed the help of
Diego to write its responses to Mimi.\\

During the first session, Diego was just teaching single letters to the robot.
progressively we increased the difficulty : the second session he was teaching
shirt words and in third session he was teaching long sentences. The last session was more like a test for Clem
: it had to prove to Mimi that it actually improved its handwriting thanks to
Diego.

\subsection{Case Study 2: Henry}

\subsubsection{Context, Study Design}
Henry is a five and half years old child. It is followed by an occupational
therapist. According to the therapist, he presents visuo-constructive deficits.
From our perspective, the main effect of this trouble during handwriting
activity was that Henry
did not have any mental template to draw the shape of a letter. So he was 
apparently performing random attempts and then was comparing with the provided template.
What is more, Henry is strongly careless : he rarely payed attention to
advices, even to what he was doing when he was currently drawing, and he was
quickly shifting his attention from one
activity to another.
Hence, the goal of this study is to face those two chalenging issues
(visuo-constructive deficits and inattention) in order to keep Henry focused
on the activity during forty-minutes interactions, and to make the robot
evidently learning from his demonstrations.\\

This experiment took place in the therapist's office. It was divided in four
sessions as well. This time, we assumed that a complex cenario like the one for Diego was
no longer relevent with Henry. We just introduced the robot and quickly
said that it was seeking help to train for a robot handwriting contest.\\

Before the experiment, Henry was working on writing numbers with the therapist.
Hence we decided to turn the CoWriter activity to teach numbers to the robot. Build on
existing iPad application actually used by occupational therapists (Dawson Toth's \emph{ABC's
Writer}), we designed an Android application for pre-test and post-test. It consisted in drawing
numbers following an helping pattern, that becomes more fine with levels in
order to increase difficulty~\ref{fig:abc-writer}.\\

Since Henry was frequently drawing horizontaly inverted numbers, or even
absolutly unrecognizable shapes, we programmed the robot to refuse shapes that
was too distant to a reference with a threshold we arbitrary fixed. In that way,
the child was forced to take care on what he was providing to the robot as
demonstration. Also, to make sure the robot was going to improve its handwriting
and to clearly show this improvement, we decided to make it completly starting
from scratch : for all numbers, the first try of the robot resulted in
a simple vertical stroke (see the first robot's try in~\ref{learning_6_demos}).

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{abc-writer}
    \caption{\small Screenshot of the Android application developed to be used as
    pre-test and post-test: the child must follow with his finger the path of
the letter or number. We count the number of times the finger goes outside of
the red-bordered area.}

        Henry decided that the robot's ``6'' was good enough, and went to
    another character: in that respect, he was the one leading the learning
process of the robot.}

\section{Conclusion}

The CoWriter project, as presented above, gives a novel perspective on educative
robots, at several levels:

\begin{itemize}
    \item robots in an educative context are \textbf{relevant and effective beyond ICT
        teaching},

    \item we can successfully \textbf{transpose the well-established
        \emph{learning by teaching} paradigm} from education sciences to
        robotics, even in a \textbf{complex form}: handwriting is difficult
        physical skill, the robot learns and interact autonomously, the child is
        responsible not only for the teaching but also for the teaching
        orchestration by managing the turn taking and the progression of the
        activity,

    \item blending machine-learning techniques with human-robot interaction
        allows for building a \textbf{believable agent}, that induces
        \textbf{social commitment},

    \item this proves essential to \textbf{sustain a long-term interaction} (several
        hours) around a fundamentally routine -- yet challenging -- educational
        task (hand-writing learning).
\end{itemize}


No surprinsingly, the role of the robot \textit{vis-a-vis} the teacher has also
been questionned (including an angry email from one teacher: ``You want to
replace us!''): as we see it, the role of the robot within the classroom (or at
the therapist's surgery) does not infringe upon the role of the adult (teacher
or therapist).  The core of the \emph{learning by teaching} paradigm relies on
the child becoming the teacher of an underperforming pupil (the robot): from
that perspective, the robot does not replace the teacher, on the contrary. It
plays a different role in the classroom, which happen to be novel as well: the
robot is the \emph{least} performing student, and however a very patient, always
eager to improve, one.

The importance of the adult is further supported by our experiments: even with
an autonomous, nominally performing robot, to put the teacher's clothes on
remains (expectedly) difficult for 5-6 years old children, and during the
experiments we conducted, the adult always played a key role at prompting the
child to give feedback to the robot or to go to the next letter or word.  At a
higher orchestration level (and as reported in the two case studies with Diego
and Henry), the educational scenarios were also always designed and monitored by
the adults.

We initially envisionned the CoWriter system to be run in the back of a
classroom with one child: this would have allowed an individual, face-to-face
remediation approach, not otherwise tractable for a teacher with 20 pupils.
This is unlikely to happen. In our experience, the teacher keeps such an
important role that the interaction and the learning would hardly occur if the
child is left alone (or even semi-alone). At the end, we can reassure teachers:
robots are not going to replace them any time soon.
